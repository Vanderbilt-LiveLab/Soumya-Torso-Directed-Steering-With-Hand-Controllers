# Soumya-Torso-Directed-Steering-With-Hand-Controllers

##### Procedure to move:-
- The "_Trigger Button_" of your dominant hand controller would allow you to move forward in the virtual environment.
- You need to hold the non-dominant hand controller on the side of your body, as this controller would act as your body tracker.
- You need to physically rotate towards your intended movement direction to move towards a particular direction in the virtual scene.
- If you are deflected in the scene because of your non-dominant hand movement, you can recalibrate it by-
    * Resting your non-dominant hand once again on your side first.
    * Then press the "_Primary Button_" of the non-dominant hand controller to recalibrate the movement direction.
- Once the recalibration is done, you will be able to move in your intended direction once again!!!
